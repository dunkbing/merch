Todayâ€™s consumers are more demanding than ever, especially when it comes to
shopping online. These experiences must feel intuitive and snappy. Even a
[100-millisecond delay in load time can hurt conversion rates by 7%](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sofist-marketing/State+of+Online+Retail+Performance+Spring+2017+-+Akamai+and+SOASTA+2017.pdf).

Our [merch store](https://merch.deno.com), built with
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) is server-side rendered (SSR) with some
[islands of interactivity](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/islands) and
deployed close to users on the edge. Sending only what the client needs keeps
the site lean and fast, earning it a perfect
[Lighthouse score](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).
